Huang Nanyou dealer Huang said, now red, pink phalaenopsis are out of stock, there are retailers shouted &quot;just give me flowers, the price you open.&quot; At present, safflower, flower diameter more than 10 cm of the price of each plant has Shouted 20,30 yuan increase in delivery, or even 50 yuan is also willing to buy. Retailers at no cost to grab the cost of goods pulled high, but also one after another in response to retail prices.

Other than mainland China, Vietnam and other Southeast Asian countries also come to Taiwan As early as August last year, they came to Taiwan to order flower seedlings one after another. After more than 4 months of introduction, they were urged to sell flowers and were sold just before the Lunar New Year. Taiwan sugar director pointed out that in order not to grab domestic flower farmers&#39; livelihood, more than 90% of Taiwan&#39;s sugar orchids for export, the domestic sales of about 8%, but recently the downstream wholesalers not only patrons shouting out of stock, the requirement to increase the volume of shipments, never had wholesalers Also come please, but the amount on hand, to meet the original customer is not lack of flowers is strenuous, not to mention the sale of goods to other wholesalers. Increase in output is also not in a hurry External concern about whether Taiwan sugar will increase supply, Taiwan sugar supervisor does not deny that indeed intends to increase production, but the phalaenopsis from seedling to flowering took 1.5 years, no relief, and amplification too much, if Domestic flower farmers rush rush rush planted, then there will be fear of egg-tower effect, affecting the flower price.

His latest view is that according to customer surveys such as Bitmain and Creative, the need to encrypt money mines is extremely strong. Bitmain is dealing with bitcoin, and ASICs for Litecoin mining have been sold out by the end of February Will be available. TSMC 16nm is not only the main process of Bitmain and Creative ASIC, but also the order of GPU of Nvidia. Now it seems that if Q1 is the traditional off-season of the industry and TSMC&#39;s 16nm process capacity is still full, the customers even expressed Robbed enough capacity is very difficult, the off-season is not light atmosphere turn thick. ■ foreign ownership rose to 79.01% US Department of Foreign Investment previously mentioned that the international agencies last year, TSMC filed back only after the entry, this time starting from the stock price of 225 yuan to cover up, with international funds poured into Taiwan , TSMC stock prices come back more urgent and fierce, further driving other legal institutions to chase the purchase. Foreign investment in TSMC gradually rose to 79.01% of the proportion of foreign exchange room manager said that with the current customer TSMC and Taiwanese attitude, the shareholding ratio is likely to once again challenge the Bacheng mark, the wave of capital to boost strength Still have to see.

                    "en": "DRAMeXchange of TrendForce pointed out that memory products such as DRAM and NAND Flash are currently in the bargaining time of each product category in the first quarter. However, due to the fact that at the end of 2017, the Development and Reform Commission of China Samsung is dissatisfied with the continuous price hike in memory. Therefore, interviews with the company&#39;s variables may cause changes to the memory price trend. The expected rise in mobile memory will be more convergent. DRAMeXchange Research Associate Wu Ya-Ting pointed out that from the perspective of capacity per unit, 2017 DRAM prices rose more than 40% over the same period of NAND price increases also close to 40% water level. The incident was caused by the fact that China&#39;s smart phone makers could not afford sustained price increases. Therefore, they filed a complaint with China&#39;s Development and Reform Commission, hoping to curb the follow-up price rise of memory makers headed by Samsung and checking whether they have any monopoly suspicions. Looking into the first half of this year, due to the factory&#39;s conservative production capacity plan, the actual new production capacity will be set to fall in the second half of the year, leading to the supply in the first half of the year still limited. The overall market is still tight. Although the market came up, the price of China&#39;s Development and Reform Commission , But the price increase will not have much impact, but starting from the third quarter of last year, with the North American data center to build tight supply and then lead to gains, the overall stock kinetic energy than expected, it is expected in the first half of this year servo Memory prices will continue the trend of price increases. TrendForce believes that because of the involvement of China&#39;s Development and Reform Commission, the price of mobile memory in the first quarter of this year probably has a substantial negative impact. Under the influence of the sluggish shipment of smartphones in China, the overall DRAM is still in a tight supply. However, taking Samsung as the leader, Huawei is the first to adjust its offer of China&#39;s smart phone makers. The increase of mobile memory has been more than that of the previous Convergence, from the original 5% quarterly growth to about 3%. As China has become the largest outlet for memory output in recent years, the proportion of memory purchased through China continues to increase, either inland or outbound, so the official intervention may be a real change in prices.

In terms of funding, it seems that the current chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, Powell, is still expected to maintain a gradual pace of rate hike after the helm of the Federal Reserve and the market is highly expected to raise interest rates three times this year and the impact on the global stock market will be expected to be as low as possible. However, the prices of gold, crude oil and bulk raw materials have all continued to rise recently. The trend of gradual warming of inflation is still to be seen if the pace of future rate hikes will be affected. While the ECB held its rate meeting unchanged in December last year and the Bank of Japan maintained a policy of monetary easing, the momentum of the funds in the global financial sector is still quite robust in the first quarter, helping the stock market to maintain upward momentum.

In considering the strong impact of short-term exchange rates on the performance of export-oriented stocks, such non-electricity sectors as financial and raw materials benefiting from appreciation, as well as medical and health technology sectors with relatively stable operation are expected to perform well.

                    "en": "2018 In the beginning of the year, a few short-term transactions, the United States stocks again attacked the high, the European shares and the euro also strengthened, reflecting the simultaneous recovery of the global economy, coupled with the funds continued to pick up, boosting the Taiwanese stocks more performance from the end of last year so far rose seven Trading day, in response to the overall global economy continued to pick up the environment. On the 5th, Taiwan stocks ended 31.17 points higher and ended at 1,0879.8 points, finishing red. Volume reached 141.342 billion yuan. Liao Zhehong, manager of Allianz Taiwan Science and Technology Fund, said in response to the recent market turmoil, Taiwan stocks basically showed a pattern of upward movement in the first week after the opening of 2018 after the shock consolidation in the last week of 2017. Although the iPhone sales figures are still not satisfactory, the demand derived from Bitcoin has made up for the weaker demand in the smart phone market. As a result, the original market expectation for the 1Q semiconductor outlook is also getting better than before. In the capital side, Liao Zhe-hong said that at this stage, the financial side obviously pick-up. According to the stock exchange statistics, the first week of 2018, four transactions, foreign accumulated accumulated up to 22.792 billion yuan. At the end of last year, it was affected by the holiday of the Christmas holidays. Most of the foreign investors showed a state of vacation in advance. Now the foreign capital has returned to its custody. This shows that the foreign capital profitable last year returned to the Taiwan stock market again and paid attention to the follow-up growth trend of Taiwan stocks. Looking ahead, including the electronics stocks, Liao Zhehong said the major focus of the electronics stocks are still the iPhone sales, as well as leading semiconductor manufacturers wafer business forecast wind direction ball. Affected by the weakened smartphone population, there may be ethnic groups that benefit from or evaluate relatively low-growth market segments such as AMD and the diode community. As the index remains high, the low-base growth stocks will be the relatively dazzling stock market performance in the near term. In the mass production sector, Liao Zhehong said after last year&#39;s good market for electronic stocks, iPhone-headed smart phone sales into the plateau phase, the relatively weak performance of raw materials and transfer stocks last year, now have the opportunity to benefit from the market Capital style conversion, the proposal may be concerned about the limited production of environmental norms in mainland China, benefiting from the Chinese government policy support the reform of ethnic groups, or lower base last year, this year continue to improve the fundamentals of ethnic groups, such as cement, steel, plastic raw materials , Low base period auto parts group also deserves attention. Overall, Liao Zhe-hong said that in 2017, Taiwan&#39;s stock market was boosted by the booming economy and foreign-invested transactions. In 2018, corporate profits are expected to maintain positive growth in all quarters and technological innovation capability is expected to push up the momentum of the stock market and show positive results. Recent investment climate in the global market to restore optimism, do not rule out the red envelopes will be available years ago. (Business Times)"

Weng Weijie said that Taiwan stocks are still in a bullish market. Looking ahead with time, even pulling back is only a pattern. As long as NTD can maintain its strong position and quarterly lines can provide strong support while Taiwan stocks still maintain a strong order Pattern, the operation should pay attention to chasing high risk. Although the Taiwan Strait continued its momentum of multi-party tyranny last year, it has been observed from the perspective of the structure that after the rapid rise of electronic stocks in the short term, the risk rises rapidly and is no longer suitable for price increases and conservative treatment. Weng Weijie believes that in the operating strategy may pay attention to non-stock prices of non-subject industries, such as: Netcom, motherboards, while short-term raw material prices with short-term oil prices finishing, will also enter the short-term correction, Low-yielding stocks, such as cement, steel or shipping stocks, are just waiting for the timing of the placement in the index turmoil this week, responding without a hefty strategy and disciplining is king.

                    "cn": "《華爾街日報》報導，儘管美股創新高，道瓊工業指數飆破2萬5千點，但美國上市公司數量卻比20多年前腰斬一半，主要是受到3項因素影響，分別是網路泡沫破滅、新創業者上市意願減低、以及併購活動熱絡所致。\n據美國芝加哥大學布斯商學院的證券價格研究中心（Center for Research in Security Prices）資料顯示，美國上市公司數與1996年的逾7,400家相比，現今只有當年的一半不到。\n網路泡沫破滅之後，許多公司銷聲匿跡，是上市公司數量銳減的原因之一。上市公司數量在1990年底躍升高點，當時數百家新創業者趁著網路興起的熱潮掛牌上市，並且大賺一筆，但最後可能不敵泡沫破滅衝擊而消失。\n其二，新創公司延後IPO時間，寧願向創投或私募基金籌措資金，也不願掛牌上市面臨嚴格法規限制。第3個原因在於企業之間合併與併購活動持續，使企業數量減少。\n近年來企業積極購回自家股票，也使在外流通股數縮減。根據標普道瓊斯指數公司（S&P; Dow Jones Indices）顯示 ，2015年企業實施庫藏股創下5,720億美元的新高。\n美股此波多頭已接近9年時間，上市公司數量持續萎縮的現象究竟是利是弊，市場人士對此各有說法。\n有一派表示這是簡單的供需問題，當注入股市的資金增加，上市企業數量與公開交易股數減少，意味股價將獲得支撐。另一派則認為事情沒那麼簡單，因為到目前為止，沒有明確證據顯示上市企業數量萎縮會直接影響股價攀升。\n一些分析師提及，許多消失的股票是小型股，這對藍籌股指數並沒有太大衝擊。保德信金融集團市場策略師柯斯比指出，小型股從公開交易所剔除，「讓市場變得更有效率」。\n此外，新創業者更加仰賴私募資本，延後掛牌時間，股市投資者更難以接觸這些年輕公司。根據Pantheon Partners資料，去年上市公司平均成立時間為18年，反觀1996年時平均成立時間為12年。\n(工商時報)",
                    "en": "The Wall Street Journal reported that although the US stock market hit a record high and the Dow Jones industrial average shrank 25,000 points, the number of US listed companies was half the number of less than 20 years ago, mainly due to the impact of three factors: the dot-com bubble burst , The desire of new entrants to go public, and the enthusiasm of mergers and acquisitions. According to the Center for Research in Security Prices at the Booth School of Business at the University of Chicago in the United States, the number of U.S. public companies is now less than half the number of the more than 7,400 in 1996. After the dot-com bubble burst, many companies disappeared, one of the reasons for the sharp decline in the number of listed companies. The number of publicly traded companies jumped to a high point at the end of 1990 when hundreds of new entrepreneurs took advantage of the boom in the Internet to go public and make a fortune, but in the end they may not survive the bubble burst and disappear. Second, start-up companies delayed IPO time, preferring to venture capital or private equity funds, but also do not want to go public listing is subject to strict regulations. The third reason is that mergers and acquisitions between enterprises continued, reducing the number of enterprises. In recent years, companies actively buy back their own stock, but also to reduce the number of outstanding shares. According to S &amp; P; Dow Jones Indices, in the year of 2015, the number of enterprises implementing treasury stocks hit a new high of $ 572 billion. This long wave of US stocks has been nearly nine years, the phenomenon of the number of listed companies continued to shrink is the pros and cons, market participants have each have their own views. One group said that this is a simple issue of supply and demand. When the capital injection into the stock market increases, the number of listed companies and the number of publicly traded shares decrease, which means the stock price will be supported. The other group thinks it is not that simple, as so far there is no clear evidence that the decline in the number of listed companies will directly affect the price rise. Some analysts mentioned that many of the disappearing stocks are small-cap stocks, which do not have much impact on the blue-chip index. Kosty, a marketing strategist at Prudential Financial Group, pointed out that small cap stocks were removed from the public exchange and &quot;made the market more efficient.&quot; In addition, new entrepreneurs rely more on private equity, postpone their listing time and make it more difficult for stock market investors to reach out to these young companies. According to Pantheon Partners, listed companies last year, the average time for the establishment of 18 years, the other hand, the average time for establishment in 1996 was 12 years.

Later, because bamboo fiber in Vietnam was too thick and not suitable for incense sticks, Yang Yufeng changed his name to gold paper, and her career was gradually on track. She won the title of &quot;Heaven Bank Governor&quot; and succeeded in creating jobs locally in Vietnam. She also successfully obtained mine permission and started Sino-Vietnam project, cover the road. &quot;In Vietnam, I learned most of my life.&quot; Yang Yu-feng said sentimentally that without these setbacks in Vietnam, she would not realize that there are so many difficulties in her life and that there will be so many wonderful things. &quot;Breaking through the dilemma The sense of accomplishment generated is that others will not take it, &quot;she said.

The global economy will continue to be positive in 2018, the momentum of economic growth in emerging markets will continue to decline, and the prices of commodities will stabilize.

Zhou Youlun, manager of Han Asia&#39;s Indian strategy yield bond fund, said that while the market fears that the U.S. shrinkage will affect the performance of emerging market assets, the 10-year bond yield of India is only 1% higher than that of the U.S. debt, which is much lower than that of foreign investment High Indonesia, Malaysia and Taiwan, together with an additional $ 20 billion in India&#39;s foreign exchange reserves, have a better physical response in India, even if the United States shrinks the table. Nomura&#39;s APX Emerging Bond Fund Manager Xie Zhixiu said that 2018 will continue to be bullish on Indian bonds, especially for green energy, such as wind power, hydroelectric power and solar power generation, and there may be new debt issuance opportunities. As for the overall Asian debt, Asian bonds with higher yield and shorter duration are still the targets for the continued increase of funds due to the optimistic economic outlook. The performance of Asian debt in 2018 is expected to outperform most bond markets.

Zhang Ruiming believes that in the next 3 to 5 years, the global economy will continue to grow, favorable to stimulate the development of emerging markets, and the world will still maintain a low growth, low inflation and low interest rates environment, in this environment, high yields, with debt Emerging market bonds such as the rise of the letter and the reduction of the default rate are still sustainable. The first gold investment trust analysis, from the evaluation point of view, emerging stocks accumulated gains in 2017 has been large, emerging bonds regardless of the dollar-denominated bonds or local currency-denominated bonds and the spread of the United States debt is still reasonable, high interest rate incentive; the same time, investment The proportion of people held below the average after the financial tsunami, the investment climate will not overheating, the opportunity to show great, for actively seeking &quot;income&quot; of investors, has considerable appeal. Prudential emerging emerging market corporate bond fund manager Zhongmei Jun analysis, the current central banks in Europe and Japan loose easing of policies, market liquidity is still abundant, emerging market corporate bond funds both growth and profit opportunities, it is worth embracing the core assets.

A record high. New Taipei City, the largest number of illegally built New Taipei City, the largest number of illegally built, about 193,000, Kaohsiung City, also has 122,000, North City, there are 86,000, in order to build the proportion of underemployment accounted for residential stock point of view, New North, 12% in Taipei and 10% in Taipei. In the first half of 2017, the number of illegal immigrants in all six districts witnessed a decrease. Compared with 2016, the numbers of contravening households registered a decrease of 14,000 in New Taipei City and 15 in the high market. Among them, Taipei City, despite the hard-line attitude toward illegal construction after the mayor Ke Wenzhe took office, still saw a continued increase of 1,288 in 2017 in Taipei. At present, there have not yet been demolished and illegally built 280,000 pairs, accounting for 42% of the total number of illegally built structures in the country. Old top plus amnesty dereliction of housing demolition more than the trend of research center director Chen Jie Ming said that the large number of illegal construction in ShuangBei City, and high housing prices, large population can not be separated from the past, top plus products for the first purchase family want to have more living space in North As far as practice is concerned, the price of stamped affixed to the top floor is only about one-third as low as that of the downstairs. As long as the purchaser buys less than one-third of the original purchase price, Space, the burden is relatively light a lot. North City has a &quot;special construction amnesty permit&quot;. Since the establishment of the People&#39;s Republic of China 84 years ago, there are no doubts about &quot;illegal construction&quot; and can be legally removed. As a result, many homebuyers and investors in the past have named their &quot; Purchasing houses and brokers also continue to use this as a marketing term, which has caused the prices of top-end products in North District to keep rising. Chen Jieming said although local governments want to demolish the illegal structures, they are limited by lack of funds and manpower. Coupled with the fact that many cases are scheduled to be demolished, the demolition of local governments will be limited and the illegal tenants will not be able to be effective Lower, it is worth the attention of the relevant government departments.

                    "en": "New generation car horsepower is getting higher and higher, CNPC is facing the pressure of the transformation of electric vehicles, at this time proposed to discuss 92 unleaded petrol is a waste of waste. What oil did not add any oil, is a personal choice, no complaints. In desperation circumstances, such as the rush to cancel the lowest oil prices, it will obviously touch the nerve of the &quot;consumer class differences.&quot; If CNOOC needs to be done, it still has to be careful. It is best if the election is implemented at a time when the price of oil is low, which will not provoke people&#39;s complaints. In recent years, the introduction of direct injection tank factory, small displacement turbocharged engine is red, a small 1.5-liter engine can be squeezed out without losing the previous 2.4-liter engine horsepower. With the cylinder temperature is higher, consumers pay more attention to the choice of oil, which is the most expensive from 98% of CNPC unleaded gasoline growth can be seen. In the current situation, the current weekly floating oil price adjustment, the media reports are always 95 unleaded petrol price for example, shows that in Taiwan, 95 gasoline has long been a balance between horsepower and price, the main choice of steam locomotive family. In fact, the general opinion is that if consumers choose to add a higher level of gasoline to their car manufacturers, they will not harm the car, but may be helpful for horsepower. Since 92 lead-free car plus 95 is not only harmless, but also beneficial, then why do some people plus 92 lead-free, most of the reasons are &quot;price considerations.&quot; So will add 92, the locomotives account for the majority, but also work needs, take delivery of gasoline car workers. In the case of PetroChina, the difference between the two amounts to $ 1.5. A month&#39;s increase will add up to tens of dollars for locomotives and even a few hundred yuan for car owners. Therefore, even if the 92 lead-free alternative is high, it is also justified to encourage a better use of the oil. However, if the sale is totally stopped, the impact on the labor and students with a modest monthly salary and pocket money needs to be considered. Even to do, but also need to choose the right time to do. For the current year, all agencies predict that oil prices will be at a high level. 95 Lead-free is currently over 28 yuan per liter and may even challenge 30 yuan. If 92 petrol is eliminated, it will force these ethnic groups to use more expensive oil. Of course, PetroChina still needs to assess that it will not stop selling so quickly this year. However, any decision to make in the future must be made in light of the time of low oil price with the least impact, in order to reduce the rally. (China Times)"

Compared to the domestic target matured debt mainly in the layout of the sovereign debt-based, KGI maturity of emerging market bond funds is based on corporate bonds, mainly in emerging markets, high industry diversification, corporate bonds and more Providing better liquidity, coupled with the relatively higher remuneration risk ratio of emerging market corporate debt, offers investors more robust asset allocation options. Li Hongzhi, manager of Emerging Market Bonds maturing six years at KGI, said that emerging markets have a higher yield advantage over both Europe and the United States. In addition, with the increase in corporate profits, there is a greater chance of falling bond default rates Credit rating has risen, statistics From 2012 to this year, emerging market corporate credit credit raiser for the first time exceeded the downgrade credit rating, which will help EM debt prices stable upward. Li Hongzhi emphasized that emerging-market corporate bonds are well-targeted and well-diversified in terms of investment targets. Emerging market corporate debt has a pay-to-risk ratio of 2.42 over the past five years, leading the emerging markets Sovereign debt shows that emerging market corporate debt is better able to generate remuneration per unit of risk. Therefore, KGI&#39;s emerging-market bond funds due six years mainly focus on emerging market corporate bonds while sovereign bonds and sovereign-like debt are subsidized. Expected the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates 3 times this year, will affect the target target debt maturity? Li Hongzhi shows that market interest rate volatility is an important key to bond prices. Taking the bond target maturity as an example, interest rate changes will be reflected in the daily net fund value. However, changes in the net value during the investment period will only affect the early redemption investment If the person holds the influence and elects to redeem in midway, he shall bear the capital gains or losses caused by the fluctuation of the net value. If the bonds are held to maturity, as long as the bonds do not default, the bonds will play the characteristics of principal repayments. As the maturity date approaches, The lower the price volatility, and gradually returned to the nominal amount, that is, holding to maturity, the target maturity bond fund layout is completed, the change in interest rates is not affect the portfolio to achieve the expected target income is the main factor, therefore, In the face of the environment of raising interest rates, investors should return to the essence of bond investment, that is, they should mainly hold debt for a long time.

                    "en": "Recently, the Financial Times (FT) criticized the government for not having a clear idea of ​​how much energy it will cost to transform its energy-transforming program in order to &quot;tide over Taiwan&#39;s fear of energy security and promote energy transformation.&quot; The article pointed out that President Cai and the DPP are promoting renewable energy power generation, but the cost uncertainty, opposition to energy supply and the promise of phasing out nuclear energy may complicate the project. FT pointed out that the investment in wind power projects alone is estimated at about 566.4 billion Taiwan dollars. Coupled with frequent summer typhoons in Taiwan, earthquake risk and high winter monsoon wind power, wind power will face challenges not seen in other parts of the world and imply Large equipment maintenance costs. In order to fulfill its non-nuclear promise, the government plans to generate 80% of the fossil fuel and 20% of renewable energy by 2025. However, we can only see the coal-fired and natural gas plants expanding wildly. The proportion of renewable energy is less than 6%. To achieve the target within 8 years, it is necessary to increase the offshore wind power by 187.5 times, the geothermal energy by 200 times and the solar energy by 10 times Great Leap Forward. The Legislative Yuan Budget Center also reported in June last year that Taiwan&#39;s green energy construction is overly optimistic. For example, in order to achieve the target of 17GW for 114-year terrestrial solar photovoltaic devices in the Republic of China, the total land area required is 25,500 hectares. However, only about 19,000 hectares are available for setting up the site after cultivation of land. Non-nuclear is a two-edged decision that cuts off doubts about the safety of nuclear power plants and nuclear waste, but also cuts out the power shortage. The inconvenience and suffering caused by this power shortage should have been &quot;prorated&quot; among enterprises and people. In particular, the energy-intensive industries that &quot;eat and earn money&quot; should take more responsibility. But now it is not the case that the government has repeatedly used the term &quot;electricity is everyone&#39;s use&quot; to try to smooth the gap between the people and the major electricity consumers. For example, where can green finance come from? If not, can we only borrow money? Will this squeeze other social welfare budgets so as to widen the gap between the rich and the poor in society? In addition, in the case of poor air quality, the addition of coal-fired and natural gas equipment will also deepen environmental injustice. Although everyone lives in the same sky, wealthy people have a higher ability to deal with air pollution. They can protect themselves and their families by driving cars, installing gas-tight windows at home, anti-air pollution equipment and even going overseas. Most of them, however, People with limited economic capacity can only be allowed to attack by air pollution and form another gap between the rich and the poor. As for the difference between North and South air quality, not to mention. Faced with the continuous growth of Taiwan&#39;s electricity consumption, the government can only continue to cover the power plant to meet? Low-energy industrial restructuring policy where? When is the world&#39;s lowest industrial electricity price in Taiwan almost rationalized? Is it really going to improve Taiwan&#39;s enterprises by creating a low-wage, low-cost, low-water-fee, low-cost mineral and competitive environment that does not have to bear the external costs?
